00:00:03.8 --> 00:00:06.8
Hello, in this video, we are going to validate a 24 hour

2
00:00:06.9 --> 00:00:11.7
time string format, with optional seconds part and optional

3
00:00:11.7 --> 00:00:15.0
leading zeros in both three parts of the regex.

4
00:00:15.0 --> 00:00:18.7
Let's start with a caret anchor, which means the start of string.

5
00:00:19.6 --> 00:00:24.4
Then we'll use a non-capturing group to match numbers from

6
00:00:25.3 --> 00:00:32.2
0 to 19 or from 20 to 23.

7
00:00:32.8 --> 00:00:35.6
Next we're going to match the minutes part.

8
00:00:36.5 --> 00:00:38.3
Let's type a colon.

9
00:00:39.2 --> 00:00:43.5
We'll match any number from 0 to 5 followed by any digit,

10
00:00:45.2 --> 00:00:49.0
and we'll repeat this pattern to match the seconds part.

11
00:00:49.6 --> 00:00:53.3
Now all we need to add is the dollar anchor, which means

12
00:00:53.3 --> 00:00:54.1
the end of string.

13
00:00:54.2 --> 00:00:57.9
Now you see that we've got three matches out of the expected

14
00:00:57.9 --> 00:01:02.5
six. Let's make the seconds part optional by wrapping it with

15
00:01:02.6 --> 00:01:07.8
a non-capturing group and adding a question mark right after

16
00:01:07.8 --> 00:01:11.1
in order to make this group patterns optional.

17
00:01:11.2 --> 00:01:14.5
Now you see, we've got six expected matches.

18
00:01:14.8 --> 00:01:21.0
If we want to make leading zeroes optional, we should make

19
00:01:21.0 --> 00:01:25.5
the first digit (pattern) in both three parts of the regex optional

20
00:01:25.5 --> 00:01:29.1
by adding the question mark right after that part.

21
00:01:31.3 --> 00:01:34.8
And now you see we've got all the matches we want.

22
00:01:35.5 --> 00:01:39.4
If you have trouble writing regular expressions that match

23
00:01:39.4 --> 00:01:47.1
numeric ranges, we can go to this StackOverflow question, go

24
00:01:47.2 --> 00:01:51.9
to the bottom of the answer, click "Run code snippet", and type

25
00:01:51.9 --> 00:01:57.6
the numbers in the text boxes to get the numeric range regular

26
00:01:57.6 --> 00:02:00.4
expression. Also, check the options below.

27
00:02:00.4 --> 00:02:03.8
If you need something like that, like matching whole string

28
00:02:03.8 --> 00:02:07.1
or matching within word boundaries, just select those options

29
00:02:07.5 --> 00:02:09.3
and click "Generate".

30
00:02:09.3 --> 00:02:13.3
If you need help with the code to run the regex in, you may go to

31
00:02:13.4 --> 00:02:16.8
the "Tools" section, click "Code Generator" link and select

32
00:02:16.8 --> 00:02:18.2
the language you're interested in.

33
00:02:18.4 --> 00:02:21.5
Now you can read the explanation of the pattern on the right,

34
00:02:21.9 --> 00:02:26.3
you can learn more about the notions explained in this video
