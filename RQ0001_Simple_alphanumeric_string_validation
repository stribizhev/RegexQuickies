00:00:03.9 --> 00:00:07.1
Hello, in this exercise, we're going to validate some specific

2
00:00:07.1 --> 00:00:08.7
alphanumeric string format.

3
00:00:08.8 --> 00:00:10.8
I'm using Regex101.com.

4
00:00:10.9 --> 00:00:13.1
Now, let's look at the requirements.

5
00:00:13.1 --> 00:00:16.2
The strings should start with one or two uppercase letters,

6
00:00:16.4 --> 00:00:21.0
then some five digits should follow

7
00:00:21.0 --> 00:00:23.6
and nothing else can follow those digits.

8
00:00:23.9 --> 00:00:26.7
So, let's start building the pattern.

9
00:00:26.7 --> 00:00:30.4
We want to make sure we are starting at the start of the string

10
00:00:30.4 --> 00:00:32.5
and we're using the caret anchor.

11
00:00:33.1 --> 00:00:35.4
Next, we match the uppercase letters.

12
00:00:35.7 --> 00:00:39.2
We don't use the plus quantifier because it means one or

13
00:00:39.2 --> 00:00:39.9
more occurrences.

14
00:00:40.0 --> 00:00:42.7
We don't use the asterisk because it matches zero or more

15
00:00:42.7 --> 00:00:45.2
occurrencies. We use a limiting quantifier.

16
00:00:45.7 --> 00:00:49.7
That matches one up to two occurrences of uppercase letters

17
00:00:49.7 --> 00:00:50.8
at the start of the string.

18
00:00:50.9 --> 00:00:56.1
Next, we match the digits and we match them five times using

19
00:00:56.1 --> 00:00:57.6
this limiting quantifier.

20
00:00:57.8 --> 00:01:00.6
We don't have to spell out like this.

21
00:01:00.6 --> 00:01:05.2
No, we just use this and we match the end of the string now

22
00:01:05.2 --> 00:01:06.9
using the dollar anchor.


23
00:01:07.7 --> 00:01:08.4
So this is it.

24
00:01:08.6 --> 00:01:09.8
This is our pattern.

25
00:01:09.8 --> 00:01:12.8
You can have a look at its explanation on the right.

26
00:01:13.0 --> 00:01:17.1

28
00:01:18.8 --> 00:01:19.5
And that's all.

29
00:01:19.6 --> 00:01:22.8
