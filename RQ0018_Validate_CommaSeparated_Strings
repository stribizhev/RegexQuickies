Hello.

2
00:00:05.1 --> 00:00:07.9
In this video we are going to speak about how to validate

3
00:00:08.0 --> 00:00:09.4
comma-separated values.

4
00:00:10.2 --> 00:00:15.0
First, we need to know what kind of pattern we use to match

5
00:00:15.1 --> 00:00:16.1
one of the values.

6
00:00:16.7 --> 00:00:19.4
In this case, let's try integer numbers.

7
00:00:19.8 --> 00:00:23.3
We know that in order to match an entire string, we need

8
00:00:23.3 --> 00:00:24.0
to use anchors.

9
00:00:25.6 --> 00:00:30.5
Now let's start. The caret symbol will match the start of

10
00:00:30.6 --> 00:00:37.2
string, then we match one or more digits, and then we match

11
00:00:37.8 --> 00:00:43.9
zero or more occurrences of a comma and one or more digits.

12
00:00:44.4 --> 00:00:48.8
And then we match the end of string using the dollar symbol.

13
00:00:49.7 --> 00:00:54.8
So this is the pattern that validates strings that only contain

14
00:00:55.1 --> 00:00:57.1
comma-separated integer numbers.

15
00:00:58.1 --> 00:01:03.3
Look, we've got all the matches here and we do not match

16
00:01:03.3 --> 00:01:04.7
any of these strings.

17
00:01:05.1 --> 00:01:10.9
If there can be whitespaces in between the commas, for example,

18
00:01:10.9 --> 00:01:21.5
here, here, here, we can add "\s*" pattern around the

19
00:01:21.6 --> 00:01:27.4
comma. This will ensure that even if we have whitespaces on

20
00:01:27.4 --> 00:01:32.2
either side of the comma, the string will get validated.

21
00:01:32.2 --> 00:01:32.7
Instead of the comma,

22
00:01:32.9 --> 00:01:35.6
you can have any kind of separater pattern here.

23
00:01:35.9 --> 00:01:38.0
Let's try some exotic pattern.

24
00:01:38.1 --> 00:01:42.6
For example, a comma in between angle brackets.

25
00:01:44.1 --> 00:01:48.4
And in order to match this pattern, all we need to do is

26
00:01:48.5 --> 00:01:50.8
add angle brackets here in the pattern.

27
00:01:51.3 --> 00:01:55.7
If you need help with the code, don't forget to check the "Code

28
00:01:55.7 --> 00:01:58.7
generator" page at regex101.com.

29
00:01:59.0 --> 00:02:01.2
Just select the language you need.

30
00:02:02.6 --> 00:02:06.7
Please note that this pattern follows a specific scheme that is:

31
00:02:06.7 --> 00:02:14.0
the caret symbol, pattern, a non-capturing group with

32
00:02:14.0 --> 00:02:20.6
a separator and a pattern, that is quantified with an asterisk,

33
00:02:20.9 --> 00:02:26.4
and then the dollar symbol comes to denote the end of the string.

34
00:02:26.5 --> 00:02:30.9
This is a common scheme for all regular expressions of this type.

35
00:02:31.0 --> 00:02:34.4
Now you can see the explanation of the pattern on the right,

36
00:02:34.6 --> 00:02:37.8
